            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>[My mission at the University of South Carolina is to do my best in every part of college. 
                I want to work hard in my classes, get involved on campus, meet new people, and grow as a person. 
                I will stay focused on my goals, ask for help when I need it, and take advantage of the opportunities here. 
                I want to leave USC proud of what I accomplished and ready for what comes next.]</p>

                    <p>USC Students need a better way to tell when Dining Hall sections 
                        close and open. Not just when the door to the building closes, 
                        but when the individual sections close.</p>
